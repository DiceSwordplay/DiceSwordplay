### Hi there, this is DiceSwordplay, or AcidDS.

 I'm currently working on making pages and maybe games later on. Most of my repos might be forks, because I'm still learning how to code. I'm currently learning HTML/CSS/JS and hoping to start Python after. I've been on GitHub only for a little while, but I'm working on making an ARG with a friend. I also like to write stories, and I'm also going to start other literature forms at a later time.
