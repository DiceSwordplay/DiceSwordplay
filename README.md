### Hi there, this is DiceSwordplay, or AcidDS. <img src="assets/catonline.gif">


 I'm currently working on making pages and maybe games later on. Most of my repos might be forks, because I'm still learning how to code. I'm currently learning HTML/CSS/JS and hoping to start Python after. I also like to write stories, and I'm also going to start other literature forms at a later time.
